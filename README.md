# Project Name
Robot Robotney and The Scribble Wars!

This game allows the player to fight off lightbulb-lawyers and goblins as our hero: Robot Robotney! It is a simple space shooter, with a visual emphasis, which focuses on the size of Robotney's opponents for challenge. Get lost in the transic landscapes, and enjoy the psychadelic theme music! Master aiming Robot Robotney's laser cannon to destory your foes forever!

Note: Level change occurs at 100 points, and enemies are worth 2.5 points each. This balances the challange of the game by prolonging its simple gameloop, made punishing by the player's very low health. The second level is endless, so as to test the player's survival mastery for as long as they can withstand falling goblins!
